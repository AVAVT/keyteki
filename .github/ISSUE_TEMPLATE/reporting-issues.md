Hi everyone, your friendly neighbourhood dev group here.

We appreciate the issues you're submitting, and it's really helping us get on top of bugs and issues that are cropping up.

However, we do have some things that we would ask to make the bug squashing process easier.

Screenshots. please give us a full board screenshot taken as close to when the issue occurs as possible. include both players boards/decks/discard etc as well as the chat log.

please copy and paste the whole chat log from the start of the game. this allows us to recreate the situation as accurately as possible and hopefully solve the problem. paste it as a comment, or as a pastebin link.

If it is a "I didn't get an aember" or a "my opponent got an aember when I should have" or a situation similar to that, please review your actual aember count below your hand. In some cases, the chat log shows incorrect information/quantity on aember generation, and it may be a simple issue of us re-writing the effect text, rather than an actual problem with the mechanics of the card, and if we know that going in, we can avoid having to test and dig into the mechanics and just fix the text.

when submitting an issue, if you see an issue that is similar, please add your comments on that issue, rather than opening a new issue, so that we dont have 10 tickets open for the same issue (ie the 6 or 7 issues we have open for mimicry right now)

please be patient. none of us do it for anything but love of the game, all of us are in different timezones, and of varying skill/knowledge levels, and sometimes the north american coders cant solve a problem that the euro coders can, etc etc, and everyone likes to get a second or third set of eyes on their work before it gets pushed live, so even though it might be an "easy" fix, it may still take a few days to get live.

if we can stick to these 5 points, we should be in a better position to turn things around in a timely fashion.

thank you for reading, and keep on forging!
